 **Here's a breakdown of the code:**

**Importing libraries:**

* `random`: This module is used to shuffle the questions and randomize the order in which they are presented to the user.

**Setting up quiz data:**

* A list named `quiz_data` is created. This list stores multiple dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a single question in the quiz.
* Each question dictionary has the following keys:
    * `question`: This key stores the actual question text.
    * `options`: This key stores a list of answer options for the question.
    * `answer`: This key stores the index of the correct answer within the `options` list (starting from 0).
    * (Optional) `hint`: This key stores a hint that can be provided to the user if they answer incorrectly.

**Defining functions:**

* `displayQuest(q_data)`: This function takes a question dictionary as input and prints the question text followed by each answer option numbered from 1 to the total number of options.
* `userAnswer(num_ops)`: This function takes the number of options for a question as input. It keeps asking the user for their answer until they enter a valid number between 1 and the number of options. It returns the user's chosen answer (index).
* `checkAnswer(user_ans, correct_ans)`: This function takes the user's answer (index) and the index of the correct answer as input. It returns True if the user's answer matches the correct answer, and False otherwise.
* `main()`: This is the main function of the program. It shuffles the quiz questions using `random.shuffle`. Then it iterates over each question in the shuffled list:
    * It calls `displayQuest` to show the question and answer options to the user.
    * It calls `userAnswer` to get the user's answer for the current question.
    * It calls `checkAnswer` to verify if the user's answer is correct.
        * If the answer is correct, it prints 'CORRECT' and increases the score.
        * If the answer is incorrect, it prints 'INCORRECT' and optionally provides the hint if available.
* Finally, after iterating through all questions, it prints the user's final score (number of correct answers) out of the total number of questions.

**Running the quiz:**

* The code uses an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to ensure the `main` function only runs when the script is executed directly and not imported as a module.

This code effectively creates a multiple-choice quiz program with functionalities to shuffle questions, handle user input, check answers, provide hints, and calculate the final score.
